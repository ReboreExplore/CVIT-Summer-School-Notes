>  Since the lectures are getting more domain specific and complex, it is becoming tedious to note down everything right during the lecture, so I usually revisit and make the necessary changes or corrections (missed slides or comments) from the recordings provided after the talk. I will again edit those notes in future which are uploaded before the release of recordings for that session as it lacks some annotations.
